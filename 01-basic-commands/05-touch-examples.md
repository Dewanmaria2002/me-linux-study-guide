Some example of the `touch` command:

1. Create a new empty file called "myFile":

```
touch myFile
```

Note: a file name should never contain spaces. E.g. "my Name" is bad. Instead, you can do "my_File" or "my-file"...etc.

2. You can create multiple files with one `touch` command:

```
touch file1.txt file2.txt
```

3. create an empty file called hello.txt inside a folder called "myFolder"

```
touch myFolder/hello.txt
```

Notice how don't need to go inside a folder in order to create your file.
